      <h1>Landing the Kespian shuttle</h1>
      <p>The sweat <span class="noun1"></span> down your furrowed brows, <span   class="adjective1"></span> 
        cheeks, and into your mouth, the taste of salt goes unnoticed and 
        liquified Cryo-gel still clings to your skin. Your lungs <span   class="verb1"></span> the space 
        inside your suit with steady but <span   class="adjective2"></span>  breathing. You feel your 
        throat dry with every inhale and the fever from within you, ripples upon 
        your lips with every exhale that follows. Your right hand is planted 
        <span   class="adverb1"></span> on the cockpit modules before you. Your left hand firmly 
        grasping the chair handle to keep you from being <span   class="verb2"></span> from your 
        seat as your body thrashes with the momentum of turbulence. The 
        window compartment to your left, ricochets. You hear the jagged 
        sediment <span   class="adjective3"></span>  onto the alloy bullet as you plummet through 
        the planets atmosphere at 4.6 miles per second. Intuitively checking 
        the oxygen pressure, you manage to <span   class="noun2"></span> your eyes and there, 
        within you peripheral, you witness the forefront before you. A 
        <span   class="adjective4"></span> landscape as far as your eyes can focus, sits within a 
        frame no wider than 11 inches. You know, confidently, the glass can 
        withstand the tremendous impact and will likely feel warm to the touch 
        as immense heat engulfs the metal around you. You <span   class="noun3"></span> your feet 
        as firmly as you can in an attempt to reach out for the pane, your hand 
        juxtaposed within the frame, yet vibrating a mirage of what looks like 
        a thousand scattered, blurry images of your hand. The pressure 
        gauge <span   class="noun4"></span> an alarm that violently propels you from your brief spell 
        and before your senses revive, your left hand, that was previously 
        <span   class="verb3"></span> into a seized position, has instinctively idled the alarm. Your 
        body spasm as it braces for impact, conducting every muscle in your 
        form to jolt. A trance of unrestrained behavior bewitches you, and lures 
        every finite cell in your body to <span   class="noun5"></span> as if a serum were injected 
        into your spinal column and is now running rampant through you in a 
        <span   class="adjective5"></span> manor.. The hull quakes before it crash lands bow first 
        onto this dusty planet, lightly powdered with terrestrial sediment. 
        Kespian.
